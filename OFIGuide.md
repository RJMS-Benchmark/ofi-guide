# Introduction

OpenFabrics Interfaces, or OFI, is a framework focused on exporting fabric communication services to applications.  OFI is specifically designed to meet the performance and scalability requirements of high-performance computing (HPC) applications, such as MPI, SHMEM, PGAS, DBMS, and enterprise applications, running in a tightly coupled network environment.  The key components are OFI are: application interfaces, provider libraries, kernel services, daemons, and test applications.

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. It is the library that defines and exports the user-space API of OFI, and is typically the only software that applications deal with directly. Libfabric is agnostic to the underlying networking protocols, as well as the implementation of the networking devices. 

The goal of OFI, and libfabric specifically, is to define interfaces that enable a tight semantic map between applications and underlying fabric services. Specifically, libfabric software interfaces have been co-designed with fabric hardware providers and application developers, with a focus on the needs of HPC users.

This guide describes the libfabric architecture and interfaces.  It provides insight into the motivation for its design, and aims to instruct developers on how the features of libfabric may best be employed.

# Review of Sockets Communication

The sockets API is a widely used networking API.  This guide assumes that a reader has a working knowledge of programming to sockets.  It makes reference to socket based communications throughout, in an effort to help explain libfabric concepts and how they relate or differ from the socket API.  The following sections provide a high-level overview of socket semantics for reference.

## Connected (TCP) Communication

The most widely used type of socket is SOCK_STREAM.  This sort of socket usually runs over the TCP/IP protocol, and as a result is often referred to as a 'TCP' socket.  TCP sockets are connection-oriented, requiring an explicit connection setup before data transfers can occur.  A TCP socket can only transfer data to a single peer socket.

Applications using TCP sockets are typically labeled as either a client or server.  Server applications listen for connection request, and accept them when they occur.  Clients, on the other hand, initiate connections to the server.  After a connection has been established, data transfers between a client and server are similar.  The following code segments highlight the general flow for a sample client and server.  Error handling and some subtleties of the socket API are omitted for brevity.

```
/* Example server code flow to initiate listen */
struct addrinfo *ai, hints;
int listen_fd;

hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;
getaddrinfo(NULL, "7471", &hints, &ai);

listen_fd = socket(ai->ai_family, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
bind(listen_fd, ai->ai_addr, ai->ai_addrlen);
freeaddrinfo(ai);

fcntl(listen_fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
listen(listen_fd, 128);
```

In this example, the server will listen for connection requests on port 7471 across all addresses in the system.  The call to getaddrinfo() is used to form the local socket address.  The node parameter is set to NULL, which result in a wildcard IP address being returned.  The port is hard-coded to 7471.  The AI_PASSIVE flag signifies that the address will be used by the listening side of the connection.

This example will work with both IPv4 and IPv6.  The getaddrinfo() call abstracts the address format away from the server, improving its portability.  Using the data returned by getaddrinfo(), the server allocates a socket of type SOCK_STREAM, and binds the socket to port 7471.

In practice, most enterprise-level applications make use of non-blocking sockets.  The fcntl() command sets the listening socket to non-blocking mode.  This will affect how the server processes connection requests (shown below).  Finally, the server starts listening for connection requests by calling listen.  Until listen is called, connection requests that arrive at the server will be rejected by the operating system.
