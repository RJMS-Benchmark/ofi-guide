# Introduction

OpenFabrics Interfaces, or OFI, is a framework focused on exporting fabric communication services to applications.  OFI is specifically designed to meet the performance and scalability requirements of high-performance computing (HPC) applications, such as MPI, SHMEM, PGAS, DBMS, and enterprise applications, running in a tightly coupled network environment.  The key components are OFI are: application interfaces, provider libraries, kernel services, daemons, and test applications.

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. It is the library that defines and exports the user-space API of OFI, and is typically the only software that applications deal with directly. Libfabric is agnostic to the underlying networking protocols, as well as the implementation of the networking devices. 

The goal of OFI, and libfabric specifically, is to define interfaces that enable a tight semantic map between applications and underlying fabric services. Specifically, libfabric software interfaces have been co-designed with fabric hardware providers and application developers, with a focus on the needs of HPC users.

This guide describes the libfabric architecture and interfaces.  It provides insight into the motivation for its design, and aims to instruct developers on how the features of libfabric may best be employed.

# Review of Sockets Communication

The sockets API is a widely used networking API.  This guide assumes that a reader has a working knowledge of programming to sockets.  It makes reference to socket based communications throughout, in an effort to help explain libfabric concepts and how they relate or differ from the socket API.  The following sections provide a high-level overview of socket semantics for reference.

## Connected (TCP) Communication

The most widely used type of socket is SOCK_STREAM.  This sort of socket usually runs over the TCP/IP protocol, and as a result is often referred to as a 'TCP' socket.  TCP sockets are connection-oriented, requiring an explicit connection setup before data transfers can occur.  A TCP socket can only transfer data to a single peer socket.

Applications using TCP sockets are typically labeled as either a client or server.  Server applications listen for connection request, and accept them when they occur.  Clients, on the other hand, initiate connections to the server.  After a connection has been established, data transfers between a client and server are similar.  The following code segments highlight the general flow for a sample client and server.  Error handling and some subtleties of the socket API are omitted for brevity.

```
/* Example server code flow to initiate listen */
struct addrinfo *ai, hints;
int listen_fd;

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;
getaddrinfo(NULL, "7471", &hints, &ai);

listen_fd = socket(ai->ai_family, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
bind(listen_fd, ai->ai_addr, ai->ai_addrlen);
freeaddrinfo(ai);

fcntl(listen_fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
listen(listen_fd, 128);
```

In this example, the server will listen for connection requests on port 7471 across all addresses in the system.  The call to getaddrinfo() is used to form the local socket address.  The node parameter is set to NULL, which result in a wildcard IP address being returned.  The port is hard-coded to 7471.  The AI_PASSIVE flag signifies that the address will be used by the listening side of the connection.

This example will work with both IPv4 and IPv6.  The getaddrinfo() call abstracts the address format away from the server, improving its portability.  Using the data returned by getaddrinfo(), the server allocates a socket of type SOCK_STREAM, and binds the socket to port 7471.

In practice, most enterprise-level applications make use of non-blocking sockets.  The fcntl() command sets the listening socket to non-blocking mode.  This will affect how the server processes connection requests (shown below).  Finally, the server starts listening for connection requests by calling listen.  Until listen is called, connection requests that arrive at the server will be rejected by the operating system.

```
/* Example client code flow to start connection */
struct addrinfo *ai, hints;
int client_fd;

memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
getaddrinfo("10.31.20.04", "7471", &hints, &ai);

client_fd = socket(ai->ai_family, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
fcntl(client_fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);

connect(client_fd, ai->ai_addr, ai->ai_addrlen);
freeaddrinfo(ai);
```

Similar to the server, the client makes use of getaddrinfo().  Since the AI_PASSIVE flag is not specified, the given address is treated as that of the destination.  The client expects to reach the server at IP address 10.31.20.04, port 7471.  For this example the address is hard-coded into the client.  More typically, the address will be given to the client via the command line, through a configuration file, or from a service.  Often the port number will be well-known, and the client will find the server by name, with DNS (domain name service) providing the name to address resolution.  Fortunately, the getaddrinfo call can be used to convert host names into IP addresses.

Whether the client is given the server's network address directly or a name which must be translated into the network address, the mechanism used to provide this information to the client varies widely. This problem will increase significantly for applications that communicate with hundreds to millions of peer processes, often requiring a separate, dedicated application to solve.  For a typical client-server socket application, this is not an issue, so we will defer more discussion until later.

Using the getaddrinfo() results, the client opens a socket, configures it to non-blocking mode, and initiates the connection request.  At this point, the network stack has send a request to the server to establish the connection.  Because the socket has been set to non-blocking, the connect call will return immediately and not wait for the connection to be established.  As a result any attempt to send data at this point will likely fail.

```
/* Example server code flow to accept a connection */
struct pollfd fds;
int server_fd;

fds.fd = listen_fd;
fds.events = POLLIN;

poll(&fds, -1);

server_fd = accept(listen_fd, NULL, 0);
fcntl(server_fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
```

Applications that use non-blocking sockets use select() or poll() to receive notification of when a socket is ready to send or receive data.  In this case, the server wishes to know when the listening socket has a connection request to process.  It adds the listening socket to a poll set, then waits until a connection request arrives (i.e. POLLIN is true).  The poll() call blocks until POLLIN is set on the socket.  POLLIN indicates that the socket has data to accept.  Since this is a listening socket, the data is a connection request.  The server accepts the request by calling accept().  That returns a new socket to the server, which is ready for data transfers.

The server sets the new socket to non-blocking mode.  Non-blocking support is particularly important to applications that manage communication with multiple peers.

```
/* Example client code flow to establish a connection */
struct pollfd fds;
int err;
socklen_t len;

fds.fd = client_fd;
fds.events = POLLOUT;

poll(&fds, -1);

len = sizeof err;
getsockopt(client_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, &err, &len);
```

The client is notified that its connection request has completed when its connecting socket is 'ready to send data' (i.e. POLLOUT is true).  The poll() call blocks until POLLOUT is set on the socket, indicating the connection request has completed.  Note that connection request may have completed with an error.  The client still needs to check if the connection attempt was successful.  That is not conveyed to the application by the poll() call.  The getsockopt() call is used to retrieve the result of the connection attempt.  If err in this example is set to 0, then the connection attempt succeeded.  The  socket is now ready to send and receive data.

```
/* Example of client sending data to server */
struct pollfd fds;
size_t offset, size, ret;
char buf[4096];

fds.fd = client_fd;
fds.events = POLLOUT;

size = sizeof(buf);
for (offset = 0; offset < size; ) {
    poll(&fds, -1);
    
    ret = send(client_fd, buf + offset, size - offset, 0);
    offset += ret;
}
```

Network communication involves buffering of data at both the sender and receiver sides of the connection. TCP uses a credit based scheme to manage flow control to ensure that there is sufficient buffer space at the receive side of a connection to accept incoming data.  This flow control is hidden from the application by the socket API.  As a result, stream based sockets may not transfer all the data that the application requests to send as part of a single operation.

In this example, the client maintains an offset into the buffer that it wishes to send.  As data is accepted by the network, the offset increases.  The client then waits until the network is ready to accept more data before attempting another transfer.  The poll() operation supports this.  When the client socket is ready for data, it sets POLLOUT to true.  This indicates that send will transfer some additional amount of data.  The client issues a send() request for the remaining amount of buffer that it wishes to transfer.  If send() transfers less data than requested, the client updates the offset, waits for the network to become ready, then tries again.
